# TSA-Claims-Visualization
Visualized TSA Claims &amp; FAA Enplanement data on Tableau. Visualization was created as a part of my project for the course 'Analytical Methods for Business' taken at USF's Muma College of Business.

## Scope of Project
Create a storyboard to gain insights from the TSA Claim data available on DHS' website. Gained meaningful insights on airport spending, claim types, different items claimed by passengers and correlated airport ratings with claim data. 

Data was merged using Tableau's inbuilt query editor. Some data from DHS was in the form of PDFs. Used a combination of ilovepdf.com and VBA Macros to clean and load the data onto a CSV file.
